# Matrix-Multiplications-via-MapReduce
### Matrix Multiplications via MapReduce: realized by using Hadoop in Java

# Project Contains
### 1) A Hadoop MapReduce program, TwoPhase.java, that computes the multiplication of two large-scale matrices using the two-phase approach (https://adhoop.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/matrix_multiplication_2_step/).  
### 2) A Spark MapReduce program, TwoPhase.py, that implements the same 2-phase approach in Spark.
